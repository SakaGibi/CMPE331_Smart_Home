# CMPE331_Smart_Home

This project is a miniature smart home system developed as a university term project (Fall 2023-2024) by **Emre Cem Kenarcı** and **Mustafa Deniz Demirhas**. It features a working hardware prototype and a mobile app interface for real-time control and monitoring of smart devices.

##  Technologies Used
- **Arduino UNO**
- **ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module**
- **Blynk Platform** (for mobile app dashboard)

##  Features
- Remote control of LED lights via mobile app
- Real-time temperature and gas data monitoring
- Servo-controlled door lock and fish feeder
- Hardware prototype built using MDF and sensors
- Fully integrated with Blynk app via Wi-Fi

##  Project Scope
All system components were physically connected and tested:
- Temperature Sensors (LM35)
- Gas Sensor (MQ-4)
- Servo Motors (door + fish feeder)
- LEDs (lighting)
- ESP8266 for Wi-Fi communication

No simulation was used; the entire project was built and tested with real components. A demonstration video is available showing the system in action.
